                      Before developing Grove Guardian, I created the original
                      pitch with one teammate before transitioning into
                      implementing the game's code. I created a Behavior Tree
                      from scratch throughout this process.

                    <span>
                      Additionally, during weekly design meetings, I
                      collaborated closely with two others, refining mechanics
                      and iterating on gameplay ideas.

                  In developing this game, my primary focus was enhancing enemy
                  behaviors by implementing a Behavior Tree (BT) system. This
                  experience marked my first encounter with dynamic AI design,
                  as my prior experience had been limited to static behaviors in
                  games like One Last Quest.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  At the project's start, I researched AI systems in gaming.
                  While exploring various methodologies, I intentionally decided
                  against Goal-Oriented Action Planning (GOAP) due to its
                  complexities, which were unnecessary for this game.
                  Consequently, I narrowed my options to two prominent
                  frameworks: Behavior Trees and Finite State Machines.
                  Ultimately, I used a Behavior Tree since I deemed it more
                  relevant after talking to my professor.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  One of the significant challenges I encountered was creating a
                  robust infrastructure for the Behavior Tree. My initial
                  research prompted two prevalent approaches: storage-based and
                  tick-based. I initially experimented with the tick-based
                  approach, but due to inexperience, the system needed to be
                  fixed, and I needed to rewrite it. At this point, I pivoted to
                  a more custom solution, leveraging an event-driven interrupt
                  system.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  This architecture allows for dynamic interruptions within the
                  BT triggered by specific in-game events. While initially
                  considering a steady reevaluation of the tree after each node
                  completion, this approach proved clunky, specifically with
                  decorator nodes such as repeaters. As a result, I developed an
                  event-driven mechanism in which each node subscribes to its
                  child upon activation, which is called after the child is
                  finished.

                <span>
                  In our initial concept pitch, we envisioned a game in which
                  players embody the guardian of the forest. Central to this
                  concept was a symbiotic relationship with the spirit tree,
                  which would serve the player with a secondary empowerment
                  system rooted in emotions. Each emotion, such as fear or
                  happiness, would give the player specific boons. For instance,
                  fear might give a protective shield, while happiness could
                  provide passive health regeneration.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Our vision included a dynamic system where the tree would
                  learn and adapt to the player's needs over time. If the player
                  took damage, the tree might shift to an emotion like fear or,
                  during a calmer moment, to hapiness to restore the player's
                  health.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  Additionally, we intended for each emotional state to be
                  linked to a unique ultimate ability. While players could
                  freely customize their four basic abilities between unlocked
                  ones, the ultimate attack would always align with the forest's
                  emotional state. For example, if the forest is in surprise,
                  players might command trees to strike enemies, while sadness
                  could create a flood to push back enemies and slow them.
                </span>
                <br />
                <br />
                <span>
                  However, during development, the game's scope had to be
                  significantly decreased due to various challenges, including
                  conflicting project schedules and a team member's departure.
                  Unfortunately, this led to a big cutdown where these systems
                  were included. In hindsight, I recognize the need for earlier
                  scoping adjustments. Still, these realizations came too late
                  in the development process, resulting in a simplified final
                  product without these mechanics.
